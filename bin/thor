## This script is called "thor" for historical reasons: until October
## 2014, "thor" was the name of the login server at Uni Basel used by
## this script.

## Note [26.11.2017]: I used to include the "-2" option, but this broken
## on kruemel on or around 26.11.2017. It seems to work nicely without
## this option from kruemel and dakar.

## Note [01.01.2018]: I added the "-D localhost:34320" line to be able
## to access unibas websites in Firefox via proxy that otherwise
## require being inside the VPN.

ssh -f -N \
    -L 34318:dmi-kibo.dmi.unibas.ch:22 \
    -L 34319:login-infai.scicore.unibas.ch:22 \
    -D localhost:34320 \
